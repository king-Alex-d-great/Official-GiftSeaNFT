                        <p>
                            Please not that it may take up to 30 working days for any request for consent withdrawal to be reflected in our systems. You must agree that while offering you our services we are making use of the blockchain/distributed ledger technology which works around creating an immutable ledger. In case you request us for a deletion/erasure of your personal data we may not be able to provide you all or any services.

                        <li class='listpsc'> Right to restrict personal data</li>
                        You have the right to request the restriction of processing of personal data if you think that is inaccurate, that we are processing it illegally, or that we no longer need it for the purposes for which it was collected. While we consider your request, we will stop processing your personal data within a reasonable time from the date we receive your request. We will notify you of our decision and any justifications for continuing to process your personal data as soon as we can.
                        <li class='listpsc'> Right to withdraw your consent</li>
                        If we process your personal data with your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. This will not affect the legality of our processing of your personal data up until the point at which you withdraw your consent. Please also note that we may still need to process your personal data on other grounds, for example to fulfil a contract with you or as required by law.
                        <li class='listpsc'> Right to object</li>
                        You have the right to object, at any time, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to the processing of personal data. If we cannot demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds to continue processing the personal data, processing of such data will cease.
